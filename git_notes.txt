git mostly makes sense not sure where we are going with the branches though, possibly we can reopen prior instances of the files to try different changes.

My favorite analogy is the evolution one, the individual commits are best described as stages in the changes species as they become different specie

switching branches is a cool way to try different things

HEAD points to where you are, multiple branches record changes on different timelines

SPIN OFF THEROY!!!!!!!!!!!


Remotes way of holding and sharing specific branches, when you have spun off only the branch that you pushed into the remote goes

git push -u origin <branch>
the first time to tell it where you want to continue to push changes to that branch.

there is no auto save you have to push any time you want changes to go to the remote.
