git mostly makes sense not sure where we are going with the branches though, possibly we can reopen prior instances of the files to try different changes.

My favorite analogy is the evolution one, the individual commits are best described as stages in the changes species as they become different specie

switching branches is a cool way to try different things

HEAD points to where you are, multiple branches record changes on different timelines

SPIN OFF THEROY!!!!!!!!!!!
